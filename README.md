# Experimental Research Project Template 

This is a template for experimental research projects in Python. It is mainly catered for systems research including web measurement, scraping, and data analysis.

## Folder Structure
- `data/` : Data files and datasets
- `docs/` : Documentation and notes
- `src/`  : Source code for tools, libraries, and pipelines you develop
- `scripts/manage/` : Scripts for managing the project. Don't modify these scripts unless you know what you are doing.
- `scripts/` : Scripts for running experiments. You can add your own folder structure for experiments and/or visualization scripts.
- `tests/` : Unit tests for your code and for debugging implementation details during development and experimentation. Ideally tests should be written to only pass or fail, not to check for specific outputs.
- `results/` : Results of experiments and analysis. By default this folder is ignored by git. Ideally, you should make a new folder for each experiment and analysis.
